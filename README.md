# Java_Collection_Framwork_Practice
Java Collection Framework is a powerful tool. It enables Java programmers to write codes that somewhat ressemble the elegence and succinctness of Python or JavaScript.

Ideally, programmers expect to accomplish the iteration-operation or checking-operation by writting just one line code. Although imperfect, the framework makes Java codes less cumbersome and verbose by reducing the use of the for-loop, conditional statement, and conditional operation.
