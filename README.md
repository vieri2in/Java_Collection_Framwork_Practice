# Java_Collection_Framwork_Practice
Java Collection Framework is a powerful tool. It enables Java programmers to write codes that somewhat ressemble the elegence and succinctness of Python or JavaScript.
Although imperfect, it makes Java codes less cumbersome and verbose by reducing the use of the for-loop, conditional statement, and conditional operation. Ideally, programmers expect to accomplish iteration-operation or checking-operation by writting just one line code.
